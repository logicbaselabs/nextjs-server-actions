## 📚 What You’ll Learn

    ✓ Why mutations feel messy (the baseline problem)
    ✓ The “classic” approach: Route Handlers + client `fetch`
    ✓ Server Functions vs Server Actions (the real mental model)
    ✓ `<form action={serverAction}>` for mutations
    ✓ Pending UI with `useFormStatus`
    ✓ Server-side validation + error UI with `zod` + `useActionState`
    ✓ Advanced form patterns: bind args, `formAction`, keyboard submit (`requestSubmit`)
    ✓ Keeping UI in sync: `revalidatePath`, `router.refresh()`, `redirect`, cookies
    ✓ Boundaries: public APIs, webhooks, streaming (Route Handlers)
    ✓ Navigation-style forms with `next/form` `<Form>` (search params)
